	<h3>WTF is this?</h3>
	<p>These are, somehow, curated news extracting relevant trends and some edge cases for borderline nerds, that don’t want to miss out, nor spend a shit-ton of time distilling trivia.</p>

	<h3>Why?</h3>
	<p>I wanted to read something like this - an information flood is drowning our times - but I couldn’t find it elsewhere. So, as most projects, it started while «scratching my own itch» and before becoming a website it lived as a markdown file.</p>
	<p>Making sense of chaos is a sisyphean task but I see it as a <a href="http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/">way of using my procrastination positively</a>.</p>

	<h3>How do you curate articles?</h3>
	<p>I cherry-pick articles that dissect trends or unveil lesser known trends and interesting edge cases, and are relevant, at least, for some months. It’s certainly affected by my biases (<a href="https://github.com/slowernews/slowernews#footnote1">I’m aware of these</a>) and most articles were on Hacker News. The articles’ listing order is not random.</p>

	<h3>How often is Slower News updated?</h3>
	<p>Only when relevant. Visit every month and «you’re good to go». New articles are easy to spot and there is <a href="https://www.slowernews.com/rss.xml">RSS</a> also.

	<h3 id="contribute">Can I contribute?</h3>
	<p>Open an issue or pull request <a href="https://github.com/slowernews/slowernews">the repository</a> with relevant links, corrections or suggestions. I’m curating only two pages (this and <a href="https://www.slowernews.com/portugal">one about Portugal</a>) but <a href="https://github.com/slowernews/slowernews#so-what-pages-can-i-create">I accept pull requests creating/curating more</a> - if you can handle the burden of using raw HTML. For now, this is my filter to accept them.</p> 

	<h3>Feeling grateful?</h3>
	<p><a href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=4J432LXV72VD4">Donate</a> or shop through my <a href="https://amzn.to/2xAL8zb">Amazon</a> affiliate link - you pay exactly the same but it keeps my motivation high. I don’t want to publish intrusive ads neither data farm with yet another stupid login.</p>

	<h3>Colophon</h3>
	<p>Hand coded - fully functional without JS - and statically hosted at Netlify via a Github repository. Tufte CSS (adapted) with native darkmode. No images, no tracking (GDPR friendly analytics with <a href="https://slowernews.goatcounter.com">Goatcounter</a>) and <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/reports/www.slowernews.com/iRNCHojs/">no bloat</a>. Ok, it uses non-standard fonts but web design is mostly typography.</p>
